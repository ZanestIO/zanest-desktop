### How To Run The Project
install node.js on your machine then in the repo directory run following 2 commands:
```bash
npm install 
npm start

### Run Unit Test
`Mocha` is a testing framework for Node.js that gives you the flexibility to run asynchronous (or synchronous) code serially. Any uncaught exceptions are shown alongside the test case in which it was thrown, making it easy to identify exactly what failed and why.

To use Mocha, I'd suggest you install it globally with npm:
```bash
$ npm install mocha -g
```
In order to run all file in the test diractory, use the mocha command:
```bash
$ mocha . 
```
